mlfourd is a Matlab package authored by John J. Lee for the [Computational Core](https://sites.wustl.edu/nillabs/nil-core-services/) of the [Neuroimaging Laboratories](https://sites.wustl.edu/nillabs/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/).  These projects support research programs of the organizational units aforementioned.  

## Features

- facilitates work with imaging data, especially data represented in three spatial dimensions and one time dimension.
- supports data formats such as [4dfp](https://4dfp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>), [NIfTI](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-2), [CIFTI](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cifti/), [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), [iEEG](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/04-intracranial-electroencephalography.html), and [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- provides adapter patterns implementing client interfaces familiar for neuroscience tasks
- uses state patterns instantiating lightweight objects optimized for categories of data and behavior
